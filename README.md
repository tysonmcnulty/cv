## About Me

I've been a full-time software developer since 2012. I currently work at [Pivotal Labs](https://pivotal.io/labs). I live in the Boston area. I use he/him pronouns. You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyson-mcnulty-611146b/).

When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, powerlifting,creating music, a fresh cup of coffee, or playing a nice, immersive RPG.

## Career

### **Software Engineering Manager**, Pivotal Labs (2017-present)

* Provided career mentorship and advocacy for my team of five direct reports
* Continued my software engineering responsibilities under Pivotal's "player-coach" leadership model
* Strategized with leadership to identify and carry out office-wide initiatives on behalf of the business

#### Details

I took on the people manager role in an effort to make a stronger impact on the success of my office, and in doing so, I developed a new perspective on the operation of our business. A large part of people management at my level could be summarized as bridging our leadership's goals with the individual intentions and motivations of my reports. I have found that I'm able to produce such alignment best when I am able to practice candor, empathy, and trust on both sides of that bridge.

My time in this role has been split between 90% engineering and 10% people management. Maintaining my responsibilities as a contributor motivates me to a high degree, and I love that it keeps me attuned to the experiences of the majority of the office and to my reports.

### **Software Engineer**, Pivotal Labs (2015-present)

* Collaborated to build and deliver full-stack, distributed, cloud-native software products for our clients
* Consulted in a client-facing role with customer organizations across industries: health care, personal insurance, federal (DoD), financial services
* Adopted and championed Pivotal's test-driven development (TDD), pair programming, and DevOps practices

#### Details

Becoming a software engineer at Pivotal Labs has been a profoundly transformative experience for me. At Labs, we espouse a very structured work methodology for its Labs teams: we aim to colocate 40 hours a week, pair program for 100% of our development time, and test-drive 100% of our code. Exceptions arose, but proved the rule--a deep understanding and commitment to Pivotal's engineering practices brought me and my teams product success time and time again.

Software engineering has been only one component of my role. We are consultants, first and foremost, driving constantly toward our client's definition of success. Most of my project teams have been split 50/50 between Pivots and clients, and we prioritize pairing with our client's team members while we are onboarding them to our methodologies. As I have matured in my role, my daily project activities have become nearly 100% client-facing.

## About Me

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tyson.

I love solving tough problems, improving lives through technology, growing communities, and making the world a better place.

At work, I've found success as a software engineer, consultant, technical leader, and people manager. Since 2008, I have been creating great software inside many organizations with the help of some amazing people. I do my best work when I am part of a team that is ethical, curious, diverse, motivated, and kind. I currently work at [Infinite Labs](https://www.infiniteranges.com/infinite-labs).

At home, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, making music, working out, gaming, and drinking fresh coffee. If you'd like to get in touch, you can reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyson-mcnulty-611146b/); I use he/him pronouns.

## Skills

I like working full-stack, and then some. I write my best code when I write my tests first, and I can teach you TDD, too, if you want. I think great code works well *and* conveys meaning to the people reading it. I like putting working software in the hands of real users, as often as possible. I like deploying my software to production when all of my tests pass, and I like doing whatever it takes to make that a reliable, secure, and automated process. I like Agile more than waterfall, and I like XP best of all, but I know through experience that a culture of trust and empowerment matters more than the current management paradigm.

I've worked with a lot of different software languages, frameworks, technologies, tools, and business applications. I'm excellent with React/TypeScript frontends, Spring Boot backends, and Kubernetes-based platforms, but by no means limited to those options. I'm flexible on persistence layers and data services. If you're looking for more detail, I keep track of that stuff in a [skills matrix](./skills.md).

## Career

### **Principal Software Engineer**, [VMware Tanzu Labs](https://tanzu.vmware.com/labs)/[Infinite Labs](https://www.infiniteranges.com/infinite-labs) (2021-now)

* Serve in a strategic full-stack engineering lead role across various industries
* Test the limits of our processes and practices in chsllenging client engagements
* Deepen our technical consulting practice around strategic technologies
* Deliver high-priority outcomes in shifting business landscapes

<details><summary><a style="cursor:pointer;">More...</a></summary>
<p>
Returning to the Labs team as a principal engineer has been an exciting opportunity to test what I learned working inside of a product organization. I have brought new insights and appreciation for our clients' experiences from my time on the "product side" with EverQuote. This time around, I have been staffed to projects in financial services, federal government, veterans' affairs, renewable energy, health care/wearables, large-scale retail, and international shipping.
</p>

<p>
As a principal engineer, I routinely leverage both the breadth and depth of my past experiences. Sometimes, I am staffed as a generalist, identifying the areas of a project that need the most help, and learning what I need to learn to make the most impactful improvements. Other times, I am staffed as an expert in a core technology that's of use to the client, and expected to provide technical expertise and/or mentorship.
</p>

<p>
By choice, my role does not include people-management responsibilities this time around. However, as a principal engineer, I tended to be used in more of a tactical or strategic role on engagements. Sometimes that meant working closely with a dev team, as a tech lead, helping the team adopt practices that led to long-term success. Other times, I would consult closer to the account level, helping our delivery teams chart a path to success with client leadership. In other projects, I would work as a software architect, helping to devise a high-level plan for large projects spanning several delivery teams.
</p>

<p>
I've navigated a few significant shifts in company culture this time around. Our in-person consulting strategy had to adapt to a remote-first world. Ironically, with many organizations in our industry returning to office, we are now navigating the opposite change. And, in the wake of the VMware-Broadcom merger, the Tanzu Labs team has become Infinite Labs, a part of Infinite Ranges. I have learned a lot about staying focused and grounded in times of change.

### **Principal Software Engineer**, [EverQuote](https://www.everquote.com/about) (2020-2021)

* Led development of expansive new partner- and customer-facing online insurance product
* Contributed to new and existing microservices (Spring Boot/Kotlin, NodeJS, Go) and apps (mostly React) on multiple Kubernetes platforms
* Introduced and aligned industry-leading technical practices (Event Storming, Test-Driven Development, GitOps) among both a small team of direct reports and a larger set of collaborators

<details><summary><a style="cursor:pointer;">More...</a></summary>
<p>
At EverQuote, I got the chance delve deeply into the online advertising and insurance space. Upon arrival, I was put to work immediately to the task of bootstrapping a brand-new product with a very small team. I brought my "consulting toolkit" to bear, leaning especially on techniques for getting a newly formed team communicating effectively and producing useful software quickly. The product went live in production after 2-3 months of initial development, and was earning over $50K/day of revenue by the end of my tenure.
</p>

<p>
My job also included people management responsibilities. I had one direct report when hired, with plans to hire or reorg to add more to my team. The product team grew from about 3 people to 15-20, very few of whom reported directly to me, which created challenges of its own! After nine months, I had to make a decision on whether to see the project through to the next phase with a team of 6-7. Ultimately, I decided to return to consulting.

### **Software Engineering Manager**, Pivotal Labs (2017-2020)

* Provide career mentorship and advocacy for my team of five direct reports
* Deepen my software engineering practice simultaneously under Pivotal's "player-coach" management model
* Strategize with leadership to identify and carry out office-wide initiatives on behalf of the business

<details><summary><a style="cursor:pointer;">More...</a></summary>
<p>
I took on the people manager role in an effort to make a stronger impact on the success of my office, and in doing so, I developed a new perspective on the operation of our business. A large part of people management at my level could be summarized as bridging our leadership's goals with the individual intentions and motivations of my reports. I have found that I'm able to produce such alignment best when I am able to practice candor, empathy, and trust on both sides of that bridge.
</p>

<p>
As a "P-level manager," I straddled the line between technical and organizational leadership. The role was about between roughly 75-90% engineering and 10-25% people management, depending on need. Maintaining my responsibilities as a contributor motivates me to a high degree, and I love that it keeps me attuned to the experiences of the majority of the office and to my reports.

### **Software Engineer**, Pivotal Labs (2015-2017)

* Collaborate to build and deliver full-stack, distributed, cloud-native software products for our clients
* Consult in a client-facing role with customer organizations across industries: health care, personal insurance, federal (DoD), financial services
* Adopt and champion Pivotal's test-driven development (TDD), pair programming, and DevOps practices

<details><summary><a style="cursor:pointer;">More...</a></summary>
<p>
Becoming a software engineer at Pivotal Labs has been a profoundly transformative experience for me. At Labs, we espouse a very structured work methodology for its Labs teams: we aim to colocate 40 hours a week, pair program for 100% of our development time, and test-drive 100% of our code. Exceptions arise, but prove the rule--a deep understanding and commitment to Pivotal's engineering practices bring me and my teams product success time and time again.
</p>

<p>
Software engineering has been only one component of my role. We are client-facing consultants as well, driving constantly toward our their definition of success. Most of my project teams have been split 50/50 between Pivots and clients, and we prioritize pairing with our client's team members while we are onboarding them to our methodologies. As I have matured in my role, my daily project activities have become nearly 100% client-facing.

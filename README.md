## About Me

I'm a software engineer and people manager with a passion for finding useful solutions to challenging problems.

In my career, I feel deeply rewarded when my work product enhances someone's life or makes the world a better place. For many years, I've mostly been making software to bring that about, but recently, it's involved some people management as well. I do my best work when I am part of a team that is diverse, motivated, curious, and kind.

I live near Boston, Massachusetts, and I currently work at [EverQuote](https://www.everquote.com/about). You can reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyson-mcnulty-611146b/); I use he/him pronouns.

When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, strength training, creating music, playing video games, and/or a fresh cup of coffee.

## Skills

I've worked with a lot of different software languages, frameworks, technologies, and applications. I've built some pretty cool software with the help of some amazing people.

<p>
At EverQuote, I've gotten the chance delve deeply into the online advertising and insurance space. Upon arrival, I was put to work immediately to the task of bootstrapping a brand-new product with a very small team. I have brought my "consulting toolkit" to bear, leaning especially on techniques for getting a newly formed team communicating effectively and producing useful software quickly.
</p>
  
<p>
As a "P-level manager," I still straddle the fence of technical and organizational leadership. My product has grown from a full-time staff of about 3 people to 15-20, very few of whom report directly to me, which has created challenges of its own!

<details><summary>More...</summary>
<p>I took on the people manager role in an effort to make a stronger impact on the success of my office, and in doing so, I developed a new perspective on the operation of our business. A large part of people management at my level could be summarized as bridging our leadership's goals with the individual intentions and motivations of my reports. I have found that I'm able to produce such alignment best when I am able to practice candor, empathy, and trust on both sides of that bridge.</p>

<p>My time in this role has been split between 90% engineering and 10% people management. Maintaining my responsibilities as a contributor motivates me to a high degree, and I love that it keeps me attuned to the experiences of the majority of the office and to my reports.</p>

<details><summary>More...</summary>
<p>Becoming a software engineer at Pivotal Labs has been a profoundly transformative experience for me. At Labs, we espouse a very structured work methodology for its Labs teams: we aim to colocate 40 hours a week, pair program for 100% of our development time, and test-drive 100% of our code. Exceptions arise, but prove the rule--a deep understanding and commitment to Pivotal's engineering practices bring me and my teams product success time and time again.</p>

<p>Software engineering has been only one component of my role. We are client-facing consultants as well, driving constantly toward our their definition of success. Most of my project teams have been split 50/50 between Pivots and clients, and we prioritize pairing with our client's team members while we are onboarding them to our methodologies. As I have matured in my role, my daily project activities have become nearly 100% client-facing.</p>
